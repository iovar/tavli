Idea now is, there's a rule engine that is agnostic to players. It just switches between them, and checks if what they try to do is do-able.
First the game will be developed in human vs human mode.
Then I can plug an opponent based on tavli3d

M1:
- do remaining TODOs on scene.js
- do get allowed moves
- add cli quit
- add config, with side selection
- add proper printing of fame state, options 

M1: Play on cli, with both players human
M2: Cli, with pc opponent
M3: UI version

After MVP:
- add crypto dice roll
- icon, manifest, sw.js
- cleanup, refactor code
