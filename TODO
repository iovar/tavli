Idea now is, there's a rule engine that is agnostic to players. It just switches between them, and checks if what they try to do is do-able.
First the game will be developed in human vs human mode.
Then I can plug an opponent based on tavli3d

- Coopy rotation from PongNM
- icon, manifest, sw.js
- cleanup
- game engine
- unload protection
- copy back lib, link


Game engine:
- check all pointer values for .value
- hit/outYou/Op -> hitP1 / hitP2 / outP1 / outP2
- pouliYup -> upP1
- function name rules: camelCase
- imports
- remove weird repeated code
- CLI FE

New engine:
- add crypto dice roll
- get all actions on game scene (or move, with a lsit of from-to)
- showQuit (or similar)
- add fake possible actions
- add fake opponent
- add all actions for self and opponent
