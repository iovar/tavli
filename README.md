Tavli
======

A web rewrite of an old project of mine, [tavli3d](https://sourceforge.net/projects/tavli3d/).

Besides the technologies used, the original description still applies:
_Tavli3d is the greek backgammon.It consists of three games:portes (similar to Backgammon),plakoto(with pinning instead of hitting) and fevga(a game where no hitting occurs).The game is written in OpenGL/SDL/C .For now only single player is supported._
